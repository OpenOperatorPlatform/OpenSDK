# OpenSDK - Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for contributing to this project! Please follow the guidelines below to ensure a smooth collaboration.

## Branch Naming Convention
Each partner should create a feature branch following the naming convention based on the type of adapter they are contributing:


### ☁️ EdgeCloud Adapters
Branch Name Format:
```
feature/add-edgecloud-<EDGE_CLOUD_PLATFORM_NAME>
```
Example:
```
feature/add-edgecloud-i2edge
```

### 🌐 Network Adapters
Branch Name Format:
```
feature/add-network-<5G_CORE_NAME>
```
Example:
```
feature/add-network-open5gs
```

## Directory Structure
Each contribution should be made in the appropriate directory:
- **EdgeCloud Adapters** → `src/edgecloud/clients/`
- **Network Adapters** → `src/network/clients/`

## Testing (Mandatory)
To merge a feature branch into `main`, the adapter **must pass the unit tests** under the `/tests` directory. Please use `/tests/edgecloud` for edgecloud, and `/tests/network` for the 5G cores). Instructions to do so available at [TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.MD)

## Contributing
1. **Check Guidelines at [CONTRIBUTING.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).**
2. **Create a New Branch** following the naming convention.
3. **Develop Your Feature** inside the correct directory.
4. **Satisfy Unit Tests** located under `/tests`.
5. **Submit a Merge Request (MR)** to the `main` branch.
6. **Ensure All Tests Pass** before the merge.

## Sequence Diagram Example
Refer to the sequence diagram example from `docs/workflows/edgecloud/get_av_zones.md` for guidance on workflow structure:

```mermaid

title Retrieve Edge Cloud Zones
actor AP as App Vertical Provider

note over AP,CE: CAMARA EdgeCloud API
AP ->> CE: GET /edge-cloud-zones
CE ->> API: GET /av. zones
API ->> SDK: sbi = EdgeCloudFactory.create_edgecloud_client(i2Edge)
API ->> SDK: sbi.get_edge_cloud_zones()
SDK ->> i2Edge: GET /zones/list
API ->> SDK: sbi = EdgeCloudFactory.create_edgecloud_client(PiEdge)
API ->> SDK: sbi.get_edge_cloud_zones()
SDK ->> PiEdge: GET /nodes
```
